About the PHP Plugin
This plugin installs the Quercus PHP engine in Grails that allows you to run php in any Grails application. Quercus comes with JavaMail and the plugin includes the MySQL JDBC Driver.

Installation and Configuration

    Install with

    grails install-plugin php

    Optional configuration in Config.groovy
        Sample

        plugins{ 
          php{ 
            mappings = ['*.php','/blog/**'] 
            initParameters = ['ini-file':'/WEB-INF/php.ini'] 
            loadOnStartup = 1 
          } 
        } 

        if plugins.php.mappings is not defined, '*.php' is used by default
        refer to the the comment at the example Config.groovy, and Quercus' documentation

Grails/Java-PHP integration

    You could use JSP include to load PHP page from a JSP page under web-app
        Remarks: You cannot include a .php from a .gsp yet, check GRAILS-3906
    Java-PHP integration features provided by Quercus, refer to docs
        In any php page, servlet request and session are available
        In any php page, you could use any Java class

Create your Wordpress blog in 15 mins
You may create a weblog in 15 minutes with Rails or Grails, but no one will think your blog is professional! Spend the 15 mins to get your Wordpress instead. :-)

pre-requisite

    JDK, 1.6+ is recommended
    Tested with Grails 1.1 beta 3
    MySQL
    Wordpress 2.6.5, do not use Wordpress 2.7
        Wordpress 2.7 has some innovative new experimental feature, namely HTTP API, that is too powerful and not suitable for the Grails PHP Platform

database configuration

    a valid schema and user account are required. skip this section if you have prepared them already
    login as root, run the following commands:

    create database <databaseName> 
    create user <username> identified by '<password>' 
    grant all on <databaseName>.* to <username>;

    for example:

    create database wordpress; 
    create user username identified by 'password'; 
    grant all on wordpress.* to username;

    Remarks: MySQL JDBC driver is bundled in the Grails PHP Plugin

prepare Grails app

    create a new Grails app, e.g.

    grails create-app wordpress 
    cd wordpress

    install Grails PHP plugin

    grails install-plugin php

    start the Grails instance

    grails run-app -Dserver.port=80

deploy and install Wordpress

    download supported version of wordpress
    in the downloaded zip, extract all content under wordpress/* to web-app/*. (or in other structure as you wish)
    (optional) I recommended to get rid of the context path, so your user could access at http://yourdomain.com/page rather than http://yourdomain.com/wordpress/page. to do so, put a web-jetty.xml under /web-app/WEB-INF/web-jetty.xml with the following content:

    <?xml version="1.0"  encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> 
    <!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Mort Bay Consulting//DTD Configure//EN" "http://jetty.mortbay.org/configure.dtd"> 
    <Configure class="org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext"> 
        <Set name="contextPath">/</Set> 
        <Set name="war"> 
            <SystemProperty name="jetty.home" default="."/>/webapps/yourAppName 
        </Set> 
        <Set name="VirtualHosts"> 
            <Array type="java.lang.String"> 
                <Item>yourdomain.com</Item> 
                <Item>localhost</Item> 
            </Array> 
        </Set> 
    </Configure> 

    access the installer page at http://localhost:8080 or with your domain name,
        click on "Create a Configuration File"
        click on "Let's go"
        at step 3, you need to enter the database connection info.

        database name: wordpress 
        User Name: wordpress 
        Password: wordpress 
        Database Host: localhost (default, or change to your db host) 
        Table Prefix: wp_ (default) 
        Then click on "submit" 

        if your database information are entered correctly in the previous step, you should see "All right sparky! You've made it through this part of the installation. WordPress can now communicate with your database. If you are ready, time now toâ€¦", click on "Run the install" to proceed
        Enter the name of your blog and your email address. You will get a acknowledgement email immediately. Click on "Install Wordpress" to proceed
        Please highlight and copy the generated password. You recommended to login and change it immediately.
            NOTICE: at the last step of installation, there is a button that link to the login page. You will see an 'socket timeout' error after clicked on it, but the installation is actually completed without problem. You could refresh the page to continue to login.
            after logged in, go to user > your user name > new password to change password
            enjoy blogging on a wordpress! ;-)

version and compatiability

    Tested with the following software version:
        Grails 1.1 beta 2
        Wordpress 2.6.5 (there are some serious socket timeout problem for WP 2.7.0)
        On Windows

Issues

    I don't have idea on how to fix the perm link yet. You should need to edit ${userHome}/.grails/${grailsVersion}/projects/${projectName}/plugins/php-${phpPluginVersion}/PhpGrailsPlugin.groovy, and add sth like " 'url-pattern'('/*')" to map your perm-link URL to the PHP servlet.
    at the last step in the installer, clicking on the login link will get to a socket timeout error page. there is no actual error in the installation. Problem has been reported to Quercus.
    in the admin page, there are error in the plugin listing page. but plugins in zip could be installed without problem

Other PHP applications

    Vanilla forum - all tested functions work, except the following
        upon logout, an exception is thrown. issue 3303
    MediaWiki - installation is successful, but cannot access any page. probably caused by some kind of gzip compression problem
        plugins.php.mappings = '/index.php/*' (+) // or more
        "The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression."
    Dokuwiki-rc2009-01-26 - completely broken, cannot access the first page at all. (if it's not clear, it's the Quercus PHP servlet doesn't support Dokuwiki, not Dokuwiki is broken)
    Drupal 6.9 - looks good but fail to proceed in the Database configuration step during installation
